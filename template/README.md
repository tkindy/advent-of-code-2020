# Advent of Code 2020 Leiningen Template

This is a super simple [Leiningen] template I threw together to quickly
bootstrap a new Clojure project for each AOC challenge.

This is very similar to the built-in `app` template but I stripped out some of
the more general-purpose stuff. I found myself deleting lots of stuff every time
I'd make a new project for a new challenge, so I automated that.
