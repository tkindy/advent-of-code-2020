_Completed on December 22, 2020_

I was confused by this one because the numbers in the calendar jumped. 1 through
8 were in the correct order, but then came 17 followed by 9. There are more
jumbled numbers coming down the pipe. Judging by the conversation in a AOC Slack
channel at work, it seems like they were _released_ in the right order.

So anyways, this one was an understandably pretty big jump in difficulty compared
to the other ones I've done so far. For some reason, the coordinates my solution
came up with were different from what I would expect (even though they'd print
out more or less correctly). Super confusing, but it gave me the right answers
anyway.

Adding the fourth dimension for part 2 was easier than I thought it'd be at
first. I got stuck for a little while because I had forgotten to update my
`assoc-cube` function which is used to associate the new cube values into the
built-up space. Other than that, the changes were pretty straightforward. I
resisted the urge to abstract stuff out to support arbitrary dimensions given
how much time I'd already spent on this.
